# New Mytholgies

In early 2016, the NRA started publishing some rewritten fairy tales, featuring guns in prominent roles (see this ]NPR articles](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/25/471726704/nra-rewrites-fairy-tales-with-more-firearms-less-bloodshed) as an example of media coverage).

Since I had previously produced https://twitter.com/NewMythologies ... I thought I could do the same, featuring guns in prominent roles.

Uses motifs from the [Motif-index of folk-literature](http://www.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Motif_Index.htm), as found (and modified from) a [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/master/motifs.txt) in BooDoo's [mythology bot source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/).

So this is really derived from Stith Thompson's _Motif-index of folk-literature: a classification of narrative elements in folktales, ballads, myths, fables, mediaeval romances, exempla, fabliaux, jest-books, and local legends_. But, you know, "myths" and "mythologies" is... punchier.
