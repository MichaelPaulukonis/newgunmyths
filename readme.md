# New Mytholgies

A simple bot that can be found at http://twitter.com/NewMythologies

Uses motifs from the [Motif-index of folk-literature](http://www.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Motif_Index.htm), as found (and modified from) a [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/master/motifs.txt) in BooDoo's [mythology bot source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/).

So this is really derived from Stith Thompson's _Motif-index of folk-literature: a classification of narrative elements in folktales, ballads, myths, fables, mediaeval romances, exempla, fabliaux, jest-books, and local legends_. But, you know, "myths" and "mythologies" is... punchier.
